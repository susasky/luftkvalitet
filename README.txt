Shiny App to plot Air Quality Data from http://www2.dmu.dk/atmosphericenvironment/byer/sortall_files/stat6153.htm

To run the app: download global.R, ui.R and server.R to your laptop and run the app using RStudio or from the command line (you will need to install the R shiny package).

luft.R is an R script that produces the interactive rChart from the data.
To see the plot, after running the script in R:
> m1

---
need to find out how to display the rChart in the main panel because it pops-up in a new tab... can't figure out why! :)
